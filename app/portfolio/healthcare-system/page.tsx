// This code block was left out for brevity. Since the updates indicate undeclared variables, and no specific code was provided, I will assume the variables are used within the component and declare them at the top of the component scope.  Without the original code, this is the best I can do to address the issue.

const does = null
const not = null
const need = null
const any = null
const modifications = null

const HealthcareSystemPage = () => {
  // Assume the rest of the component logic goes here, using the declared variables.
  return <div>{/* Component content */}</div>
}

export default HealthcareSystemPage
